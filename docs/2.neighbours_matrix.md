To take into account the spatial correlation in the model, we create a neighbourhood matrix. The relevant file is `R/create_neighbours_matrix.r`

This matrix will inform which counties are neighbours, in order to accountfor their spatial proximity when fitting the model with spatial random effects. Two different methods are available:

1. Binary Neighbours Matrix

Binary classification of neighbouring counties ( 1 yes, 0 no) based on border adjacency.
Cons: requires specific adjustments for counties with no neighbours (e.g. islands).

2. 1-Nearest Neighbour

Identify centroid of the county and then find the county whose centroid is closest. Select this as the nearest neighbour.
Pro: More flexible when missing data is present.
Con: this matrix then needs to be symmetrized.


Current (9/8/2022) model outputs are fitted using 1-Nearest Neighbour matrix. Methods can be toggled by modifying line 8 in the file.
