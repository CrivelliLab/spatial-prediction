### Poisson Generalised Linear Mixed Model with Spatial and Temporal Random Effects

The first fitted model is a Poisson GLM with random effects for space and time and fixed effects for all the covariates of interest.

$$
\text{death} \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda)
$$

$$
log(\lambda) = \beta_0 + \beta_i \times \text{predictors} + \sigma + \tau + log(\text{population})
$$

Where $\beta_0$ will be the estimate for the intercept, each of the $\beta_i$ the estimate for the coefficient for each of the predictors used, $\sigma$ the estimate for the spatial random effects, $\tau$ the estimate for the temporal effects and $log(\text{population})$ the offset.


Temporal correlation structure: AR2.  
Spatial correlation structure: neighbours matrix 1-nearest neighbour. 


The model is fitted using the R package [`CARBayesST`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CARBayesST/vignettes/CARBayesST.pdf) , with the function [`ST.CARar`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CARBayesST/CARBayesST.pdf) (page 18)

The priors used have been kept the default as in the CARBayesST function. 
Note that the data will have to be in the specified format, that is the first K rows of the data file to be one row each for each K county for the most recent year, then K rows for the second to most recent year.. and so on.
