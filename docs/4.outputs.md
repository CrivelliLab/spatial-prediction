Model output files are:


Model 1:

```
./outputs/model_results/model_yyyy-mm-dd.rds
```


Model 2:

```
./outputs/model_results/fixedtime_model_yyyy-mm-dd.rds
```

Model 3:

```
./outputs/model_results/AR2_model_yyyy-mm-dd.rds
```

Initial results analysis can be found in the notebook files in

```
./notebooks/
```


Note: 
* always consider the model with the latest day for results interpretation.
* previous interations of models are:
  -  `fixedtime_model_2022-09-08.rds` and `model_2022-09-02.rds` (model with ALAND and AWATER too - left unnecessary covariates erroneously)
  -  `model_2022-08-25.rds` and `model_20220-08-28.rds` are both on subsets of dataa (not all counties)
